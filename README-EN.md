CSS Pre-Processors are code interpreters that read all generated code and convert it to common CSS capable of running in (almost) all browsers.
Productivity, organization and speed in code maintenance justify the use of preprocessors, not to mention that they can minify the CSS code to make it lighter.

## Bundles e Builders ![Webpack](https://img.shields.io/badge/webpack-%238DD6F9.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=webpack&logoColor=black) ![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/vite-%23646CFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vite&logoColor=white)
Bundles are packagers of modules for Javascript. A Bundle receives modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing these modules, typically in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Builders are development tools that significantly improve the front-end development experience. It consists of two main parts:
A server that serves your source files in native ES modules and a compiler that bundles your code to generate highly production-optimized static assets.

## Libraries and Frameworks
From here, you can choose a library or a framework to follow your studies or even learn more than one, it's up to you, but what I would recommend is to focus on just one until you have a nice mastery before moving on to another..

## React ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
ReactJS is one of the most famous JavaScript libraries focused on creating user interfaces on web pages.

React makes creating interactive UIs an easy task. React is component based and these encapsulated components manage their own states and functions and React will efficiently update and render only the necessary components as the data changes.

It is worth remembering that React is maintained by Facebook and used by large companies such as Instagram, AirBnB, Netflix and others.

## Vue ![Vue.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/vuejs-%2335495e.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vuedotjs&logoColor=%234FC08D)
VueJS is one of the most famous Javascript frameworks for creating progressive and reactive interfaces. Vue is perfectly capable of powering Single Page Applications when used in conjunction with modern tools and supporting libraries.

Vue provides a declarative, component-based programming model and has a very simple structure and learning.
Betting on a lean architecture, Vue requires minimal configuration when creating a project and can be easily integrated with an existing application through a simple script tag.
And because it's progressive it can be used in just one piece of an application that needs to optimize the UI, like Laravel.

Vue was created by Evan You, a former Google developer, and the framework is used by big companies like Alibaba, Nintendo, Baidu and others.

## Unitary tests
Basically unit tests help you think with the expectations of your code in an organized way, minimize the risk and effort when changing code, and encourage modular design.
The idea of unit testing is to test a small, standalone unit of code before integrating it into the larger system.
